# Textures Directory

This directory is reserved for textures that might be used by the AR application.

Currently, all textures are generated procedurally in memory using canvas-based techniques to avoid loading issues when deployed to GitHub Pages. This approach ensures that the application works reliably without depending on external texture files.
